# Combat Exhaustion
This module is a simple one, for D&D5e, that adds exhaustion to a player depending on the setting to apply exhaustion.
The three options are:
- Apply During Combat
- Apply After Combat (Default)
- Always

### Apply During Combat
Whenever a player gains HP from the unconsious state, during combat, 1 level of exhaustion is applied instantly. (Downs do not count outside of combat)

### Apply After Combat
Whenever a player gains HP from the unconsious state, during combat, 1 level of exhaustion is added to a tracker and the all those levels in the tracker are added at the end of combat. (Downs do not tracked outside of combat)

### Always
Whenever a player gains HP from the unconsious state, regardless of being in combat or not, they will receive 1 level of exhaustion
